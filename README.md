# Smart Hand-controller
Smart hand-controller performance analysis for neuroArmPLUS neurosurgery robot:

In this document, we attempt to analyze the objective and subjective features aquired from three hand-controllers for device and surgeon performance assessment. The studied hand-controllers were: microsurgery-specific neuroArmPLUS<sup>HD</sup>, and two general purpose haptic devices: High Definition and Phantom Premium 3.0 and sigma.7. A group of 30 participants selected among the experienced surgeons as well as the residents and fellows in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Calgary were recruited to perform a peg-in-hole task consisting of cotton strip micromanipulation in a limited workspace, aimed to reflect the maneuvers performed during microsurgery. The codes are provided in R Markdown platform.
